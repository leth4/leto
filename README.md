leto is a lightweight plain text editor. It is intended for use with a specific directory which stores notes, like a personal wiki. All changes are auto-saved; using a version control system like Git is recommended.

Headers and italics are highlighted. To make a header, start the line with # and an empty space. Wrap code blocks with \`\`\` for basic syntax highlighting; one of the available languages can be specified right after the first \`\`\`. You can also create inline code blocks without highlighting by putting it inside of \` symbols.

The default font is Inter, but you can input any locally installed font.

Right-click on files and folders to rename them; drag their names to move or delete them. Deleted files and folders are kept in a ".trash" folder in the working directory.

Drag the circle in the bottom right corner to scroll the file.
